2. Then in your terminal, make sure dependencies are installed by `npm install`
3. Then to run the website locally do `npm run`
3. The project will run locally and the website should appear on your web-browser. It may take some time on the first run.

You can also VIEW the code on GitHub from https://github.com/lcornwall/Dissertation but this does not have the firebase.js file for privacy reasons and thus will make the local instance not work as expected.
You can also visit the deployed website here https://osteoporosis-app-develop-c49ef.web.app/
